11.7 - Apps that use IAP to purchase items must assign the correct Purchasability type

11.7 Details

We noticed that your In-App Purchase product was set to an incorrect Purchasability Type.

VIP is set to Consumable.

Next Steps

Since the service offered by your application requires the user to make an advance payment to access the content or receive the service, please use the Non-Renewable Subscription In-App Purchase type. Non-Renewable Subscription content must be made available to all iOS devices owned by a single user, as indicated in Guideline 11.6 of the App Store Review Guidelines.

NOTE: The Purchasability Type cannot be changed once an In-App Purchase product has been created. Therefore, you will need to create a new In-App Purchase product with the correct Purchasability Type.

To create new In-App Purchase/s:

- Log in to iTunes Connect
- Click on “My Apps”
- Select your app
- Select In-App Purchases
- Click “Create New”
- Once you’ve completed all changes, click the “Submit for Review” button at the top of the App Details page.

Resources

More information on In-App Purchase Purchasability Types is available in the In-App Purchase Configuration Guide for iTunes Connect.
